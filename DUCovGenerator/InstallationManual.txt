===================================

1. Includes two different modes. (1) SideEffectAnalyzer (2) DUCoverGenerator
2. In Mode 1, it classifies all methods of current assembly at state-modifying or observer methods dynamically. In case, our tool is run for tests generated by multiple tools, Mode 1 has to be run on all tests generated by SideEffectAnalyzer.

3. Requires environment variable "DUCOVER_STORE"
